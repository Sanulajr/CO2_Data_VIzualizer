# CO‚ÇÇ Data Visualizer üåçüìä

A data visualization project that explores global CO‚ÇÇ emissions trends using Python, Pandas, hvPlot, and Panel. This interactive visualizer provides insights into CO‚ÇÇ emissions data from various countries and regions over time, leveraging the open-source dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

## Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore CO‚ÇÇ emissions data interactively using hvPlot and Panel.
- **Detailed Data Analysis**: Filter by country, region, and year to uncover trends in CO‚ÇÇ emissions.
- **Customizable Plots**: Change visualization types (e.g., line, bar, scatter) and choose metrics to visualize.
  
## Demo
_A gif or screenshot showing the visualizer in action can be added here._

## Dataset
The data is sourced from Our World in Data's CO‚ÇÇ dataset, available [here](https://github.com/owid/co2-data/blob/master/owid-co2-data.csv). The data includes various columns such as:
- `country`: Country or region name
- `year`: Year of observation
- `co2`: Total CO‚ÇÇ emissions
- `co2_per_capita`: CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita
- `gdp`: GDP of the country
- And many other indicators related to emissions, energy, and economic factors.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas hvplot panel
```

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/co2-data-visualizer.git
   cd co2-data-visualizer
   ```

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook where the visualizer code is implemented and run all cells.

3. **Launch the Panel Dashboard**:
   To interact with the visualization in a standalone app, you can launch the dashboard using:
   ```python
   panel.serve('your_notebook_or_script_name.ipynb')
   ```

## Project Structure

- `co2_visualizer.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data visualization code.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of libraries needed to run the project.

## Example Visualizations

Here are some example plots generated by the visualizer:

- **Global CO‚ÇÇ Emissions Over Time**: Line chart showing trends in CO‚ÇÇ emissions worldwide.
- **Per Capita Emissions by Country**: Bar chart comparing CO‚ÇÇ emissions per capita across selected countries.
- **GDP vs CO‚ÇÇ Emissions**: Scatter plot examining the relationship between a country's GDP and its emissions.
